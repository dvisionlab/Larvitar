## Parsing a DICOM File

Parsing a DICOM file is the first step in handling medical imaging data with Larvitar. It allows you to extract metadata and organize the data into a structured format. Larvitar uses the [dicomParser library](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/dicomParser) to read and parse DICOM files efficiently.

### Overview
You can parse:

- **A single DICOM file**: Ideal for simple workflows where you need to analyze one image.
- **A list of DICOM files**: Useful for handling series of images, such as those in CT or MRI datasets.

After parsing, Larvitar returns a structured data object where the key is a uniqueId, and the value is an object containing detailed characteristics such as metadata and other information. This structure follows the Series type, which you can explore [here](https://github.com/dvisionlab/Larvitar/blob/master/imaging/types.d.ts#L160).

The main logic for parsing is implemented in Larvitar's [imageParsing.ts](https://github.com/dvisionlab/Larvitar/blob/master/imaging/imageParsing.ts) file.

### Parsing API

```typescript
import { readFile, readFiles } from 'larvitar';

// Read a single DICOM file
readFile(file:File).then((series) => {
  console.log('Parsed series:', series);
});

// Read multiple DICOM files
readFiles(files:File[]).then((series) => {
  console.log('Parsed series:', series);
});
```

## Structure of a Series Object

The Series type defines the structure of parsed DICOM data. Here are the main properties of the object:

| Property                        | Description                                                      | Explanation                                     |

### Larvitar Series Instance UID

The `larvitarSeriesInstanceUid` is a unique identifier generated by Larvitar to represent a series of DICOM images in the application. It is used internally to group and manage series effectively. Unlike the DICOM standard's SeriesInstanceUID, this identifier is tailored for Larvitarâ€™s internal workflows and ensures consistency in handling specific scenarios, such as single-frame modalities.

#### How It Works

1. **Grouping by SeriesInstanceUID**:
   - Typically, images with the same `SeriesInstanceUID` (as defined by the DICOM standard) belong to the same series. Larvitar uses this value to group instances into series.

2. **Single-Frame Modalities**:
   - For certain modalities that are inherently single-frame, Larvitar uses the `SOPInstanceUID` as the unique identifier instead of the `SeriesInstanceUID`. This ensures that each single-frame image is treated as its own series.

The following modalities, identified by the DICOM tag (0008,0060), are considered single-frame modalities in Larvitar:

| Modality	 | Description                   |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| `CR`	    | Computed Radiography          |
| `DX`	    | Digital Radiography           |
| `MG`	    | Mammography                   |
| `PX`	    | Panoramic X-ray               |
| `RF`	    | Radio Fluoroscopy             |
| `XA`	    | X-ray Angiography             |
| `US`	    | Ultrasound                    |
| `IVUS`	    | Intravascular Ultrasound      |
| `OCT`	    | Optical Coherence Tomography  |
| `SR`	    | Structured Report             |

For these modalities, each instance is treated as its own unique series by setting the `larvitarSeriesInstanceUid` to the `SOPInstanceUID`  .

#### Key Points to Remember

- **Purpose of the Larvitar Series Instance UID**:
  - It provides a consistent way to manage series across various scenarios in Larvitar.
  - It simplifies grouping by ensuring single-frame modalities are treated uniquely.

- **Relation to SeriesInstanceUID**:
  - When available and appropriate, the DICOM `SeriesInstanceUID` is used for grouping images.
  - For single-frame modalities, the `SOPInstanceUID` is used instead.

 
### ImageIds

The `imageIds` array is a collection of identifiers generated by a DICOM [image loader](./loading.md) for each image in a series. These identifiers are crucial for locating, loading, and managing images within the viewer. Larvitar ensures that the `imageIds` array is ordered to facilitate logical image navigation and proper visualization.

#### Ordering Logic

The imageIds array is ordered based on the following DICOM tags:

1. **Primary Ordering**: `InstanceNumber` (0020,0013)
   - If the `InstanceNumber` exists in the DICOM metadata, the `imageIds` array is sorted by this value.
   - The `InstanceNumber` tag is commonly used to indicate the order of images within a series.

2. **Fallback Ordering**: `ImagePositionPatient` (0020,0032)
   - If the `InstanceNumber` is missing or inconsistent, the array is ordered by the `ImagePositionPatient`, which specifies the 3D spatial position of the image.
   - This ensures images are ordered logically based on their position in space.

3. **Additional Ordering** for 4D Data: `ContentTime` (0008,0033)
   - For 4D datasets, such as dynamic MRI or CT, an additional level of ordering is applied.
   - After ordering by `InstanceNumber` or `ImagePositionPatient`, the array is further sorted by `ContentTime`, which specifies the acquisition time of each frame.

####  Key Features

- **Consistent Navigation**: The ordered imageIds array ensures smooth scrolling and accurate representation of image sequences.
- **Support for Multi-Frame and 4D Datasets**: Special handling for 4D datasets ensures frames are displayed in the correct temporal order.
- **Fallback Logic**: Robust fallback mechanisms prevent issues with incomplete or inconsistent DICOM metadata.

### Instances

The instances object is a key-value map where:

- Key: A unique `imageId` generated by the [image loader](./loading.md) for a DICOM image.
- Value: An `Instance` object that contains metadata and details for the corresponding DICOM image.
 
This object is critical for accessing and managing individual images in a series, providing all the necessary information to load, display, and interact with the image.

#### Structure of an Instance Object

Each `Instance` object represents the `metadata` and properties of a single DICOM image. The structure of the Instance object is defined here:

| Property          | Description                                       | Explanation                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `metadata`        | Metadata of the image                             | [Link](parsing.md#metadata)           |
| `pixelData`       | Pixel data of the image                           | [Link](parsing.md#pixeldata)          |
| `dataSet`         | The parsed DICOM dataset for the image (optional) | [Link](parsing.md#dataset)            |
| `file`            | The original DICOM file object (optional)         | -                                     |
| `instanceId`      | The unique identifier for the instance            | -                                     |
| `frame`           | The index of the frame in a multiframe image      | -                                     |
| `overlays`        | Overlays present in the image (optional)          | [Overlays](../api/modules/overlays.md)|

### InstanceUIDs

The `instanceUIDs` property is a key-value map where:

- **Key**: The `SOPInstanceUID` (unique identifier) for each DICOM instance.
- **Value**: The `imageId` corresponding to the instance, generated by the [image loader](./loading.md).
This property provides a direct mapping between the `SOPInstanceUID` and the `imageId`, ensuring that images are ordered logically and consistently within a series.

#### Key Features of instanceUIDs

1. **Ordering**:
   - The `instanceUIDs` map is ordered by the [larvitar ordering logic](parsing.md#ordering-logic).
   - This ensures that images are arranged correctly for sequential navigation or temporal analysis.

2. **Quick Lookup**:
   - The `SOPInstanceUID` serves as a unique identifier for each image, making it easy to find the corresponding imageId.

3. **Integration**:
   - The `instanceUIDs` property is critical for linking DICOM metadata (`SOPInstanceUID`) with Larvitarâ€™s internal data (`imageId`).

#### Example Structure of instanceUIDs

Hereâ€™s an example of an instanceUIDs object:

```typescript
const instanceUIDs = {
  '1.2.840.113619.2.55.3.604688641.12345.1': 'imageId1',
  '1.2.840.113619.2.55.3.604688641.12345.2': 'imageId2',
  '1.2.840.113619.2.55.3.604688641.12345.3': 'imageId3',
};
```

### DataSet

The dataSet property contains the parsed DICOM dataset for a series or image. It is a structured object that provides detailed information about the DICOM file, including metadata, pixel data, and other attributes.

This object is generated by the [dicomParser library](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/dicomParser) and serves as the foundation for extracting and processing DICOM data in Larvitar.

When the `dataSet` property is present, you can access the DICOM metadata and pixel data directly from the object.

### Metadata

The `metadata` property contains the DICOM metadata extracted from a DICOM file. It is a structured object that represents the attributes and values of the DICOM file, such as patient information, study details, and image characteristics.

This property is essential for understanding and analyzing the DICOM data, as it provides a comprehensive view of the image properties and associated information.

#### Structure of Metadata

The metadata object is organized as a key-value map, where:

- **Key**: The DICOM tag (group, element) in hexadecimal format, such as `x00100010` for the patient's name.
- **Value**: The corresponding value of the DICOM attribute, such as the patient's name "John Doe".

In some cases larvitar exposes some human readable values for some tags, for example the patient's name, the patient's birth date, the study date, etc.
See the [MetadataReadable type](https://github.com/dvisionlab/Larvitar/blob/master/imaging/MetaDataReadable.d.ts) for more information.

```typescript
const metadata = {
   'x00100010': 'John Doe',
   'x00100020': '12345',
   'x00100030': '19800101',
   // Other DICOM attributes...
};
```

### PixelData

The `pixelData` property contains the raw pixel data of a DICOM image. It is a typed array that represents the image in its pixel format, such as Uint8Array, Uint16Array, or Float32Array.

This property is essential for rendering and displaying the image in the viewer, as it provides the actual pixel values that make up the image.

### Bytes

The `bytes` property indicates the number of allocated bytes for a DICOM series or image. It represents the total size of the DICOM data in memory, including metadata, pixel data, and other information.

This property is useful for estimating memory usage and optimizing data handling in Larvitar.
