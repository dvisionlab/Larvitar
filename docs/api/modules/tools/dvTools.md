## Introduction: dvTools

The following tools are part of the D/Vision Lab's suite of custom imaging tools, designed to enhance functionality and user interaction within imaging workflows. These tools provide advanced capabilities for annotation, segmentation, measurement, and visualization, tailored to meet diverse application requirements:

- **ThresholdsBrushTool:** A tool for applying brush-based threshold segmentation.
- **PolylineScissorsTool:** Enables precise cutting of regions using polyline-defined boundaries.
- **WwwcRemoveRegionTool:** Allows users to adjust Window/Level while excluding specific regions from consideration.
- **WSToggleTool:** This module offers functionalities for the Watershed Segmentation Algorithm and it enables the segmentation of regions based on defined thresholds within a selected brush area. The tool providesefficient identification of features with similar density and it's applicable to a single image slice or across an entire volume stack.
- **RectangleRoiOverlayTool:** Displays rectangular region-of-interest (ROI)
- **EllipticalRoiOverlayTool:** Similar to the rectangular ROI overlay tool, but designed for elliptical regions.
- **BorderMagnifyTool:** Provides magnification of image within a square borders for detailed examination.
- **CustomMouseWheelScrollTool:** Customizes mouse wheel scrolling behavior for specific use cases.
- **LengthPlotTool:** Tool for tracing 3 lines with a configurable offset and draw the plot of greyscale values along the lines
- **LengthTool:** A standard tool for measuring linear distances in images.
- **RectangleRoiTool:** Enables selection and interaction with rectangular ROIs with their statistics info ( area, perimeter, mean, variance, stdDev, min, max, meanStdDevSUV).
- **EllipticalRoiTool:** A tool for defining and manipulating elliptical ROIs with their statistics info.
- **FreehandRoiTool:** Allows users to draw freehand ROIs for flexible region selection with their statistics info.
- **OverlayTool:** Displays custom overlays for annotations or data visualization.
