- `loaders/resliceLoader` custom loader for resliced data
- `tools/customTool` is a the main file used to initialize custom cornerstone tools
- `tools/contourTool` is a custom cornerstone tool for 2D visualization of segmented images
- `tools/diameterTool` is a custom cornerstone tool for 2D visualization of diameter widgets
- `tools/editMaskTool` is a custom cornerstone tool for 2D visualization of segmentation masks with brush functionalities
